# Michigan Legislature Hearing Processor - Project Context

## Hybrid Architecture Decision

### Why TypeScript for Scraping (I/O Bound)
1. **JavaScript-heavy sites** - Senate uses Castus platform with dynamic content requiring Puppeteer
2. **Best-in-class browser automation** - Puppeteer/Playwright native to Node.js
3. **Async I/O excellence** - Node's event loop perfect for concurrent web requests
4. **Already working** - House scraper works perfectly, no need to rewrite

### Why Python for Transcription (CPU Bound)
1. **Multiprocessing power** - Uses all 14 cores on M3 Max (Node.js is single-threaded)
2. **ML ecosystem** - Faster-whisper, numpy, FFmpeg integration is native
3. **20x faster performance** - Proven faster than any Node.js solution
4. **Parallel chunk processing** - Can process 150+ chunks simultaneously

### Architecture Flow
```
TypeScript Scrapers → PostgreSQL → Python Processor
(Network I/O)         (Queue)      (CPU Compute)
```

## State Affairs Technical Exercise Requirements

### Main Objective
Build a system that can be executed on a schedule (e.g., via cron) with the following responsibilities:

1. **Detect newly published hearing videos** on the House and Senate archives
   - Michigan House: https://house.mi.gov/VideoArchive
   - Michigan Senate: https://cloud.castus.tv/vod/misenate/?page=ALL

2. **Download any new videos** that have not yet been processed

3. **Transcribe the contents** of the downloaded videos

4. **Handle failures gracefully** and ensure the system can recover without manual intervention

### Requirements
- The system should be designed to run periodically and be safe to invoke multiple times
- It should track previously processed videos to avoid re-downloading or re-transcribing the same content
- Transcription can be performed locally or through a third-party service
- The code should be modular, well-structured, and production-quality

### Submission
- Private GitHub repository
- Share with @FredLoh
- Submit at least 24 hours prior to onsite interview

## Important Commands

### Clean Start
```bash
# Stop and clean everything
docker-compose down -v
rm -rf tmp/videos/* tmp/chunks/* transcriptions/*

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d postgres
sleep 5  # Wait for DB

# Run with 3 videos
MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=3 ./scripts/run-local.sh
```

### Cleanup Orphaned Files
```bash
# Check what videos exist
ls -la tmp/videos/

# Check transcription status for videos
docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U michigan_user -d michigan_hearings -c \
"SELECT id, title, download_status, transcription_status FROM hearings WHERE download_status = 'completed';"

# Manually clean up transcribed videos
docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U michigan_user -d michigan_hearings -c \
"SELECT id FROM hearings WHERE transcription_status = 'completed';" | \
while read id; do rm -f tmp/videos/${id}.mp4; done

# Clean all chunks (they should be temporary)
rm -rf tmp/chunks/*
```

### Testing Transcription Only
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://michigan_user:changeme@localhost:5432/michigan_hearings \
python3 scripts/parallel_processor.py --transcriptions 2 --chunk-duration 30
```

## Key Features

1. **Chunked Transcription** - ONLY uses chunked transcription for large videos
   - Splits audio into ~30 second chunks at silence boundaries
   - Processes chunks in parallel using multiprocessing
   - Much faster than sequential transcription

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Downloads multiple videos concurrently (default: 3)
   - Transcribes multiple videos concurrently (default: 2)
   - Each video's chunks are processed in parallel

3. **Performance Tracking**
   - Shows speedup (e.g., "3.5x realtime")
   - Tracks success/failure counts
   - Summary statistics at the end

## Common Issues

1. **Pickle Error** - Fixed by moving transcribe_chunk to module level
2. **Database Status** - Videos stuck in 'processing' need manual reset:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U michigan_user -d michigan_hearings -c \
   "UPDATE hearings SET transcription_status = 'pending' WHERE transcription_status = 'processing';"
   ```
3. **Senate Scraper** - Uses Puppeteer for JavaScript-heavy site
   - Senate videos may be m3u8 streams instead of direct MP4s
   - VideoProcessor handles both MP4 and m3u8 downloads
   - m3u8 streams are downloaded using ffmpeg

4. **Video/Chunk Cleanup Not Working**
   - Check DELETE_AFTER_TRANSCRIPTION env variable
   - Ensure cleanup happens in parallel_processor.py after transcription
   - Check for orphaned files in tmp/videos and tmp/chunks
   - Cleanup function needed at start of run-local.sh

## File Locations

- Scripts: `./scripts/`
- Logs: `./logs/`
- Videos: `./tmp/videos/` (created dynamically during processing)
- Chunks: `./tmp/chunks/` (created dynamically during processing)
- Transcriptions: `./transcriptions/`

Note: The `tmp/` folder is created when processing starts and removed when complete.

## Environment Variables

- `MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN` - Limit videos per run (default: -1 for unlimited)
- `DELETE_AFTER_TRANSCRIPTION` - Delete videos after transcription (default: true)
- `WHISPER_MODEL` - Whisper model size (default: small)
- `TRANSCRIPTION_MODE` - 'quality' or 'fast' (default: quality)

## Current Implementation Status

### Scrapers
- **House Scraper**: ✅ UPDATED - Direct MP4 downloads from house.mi.gov
  - Now scans ALL videos (~1000+), not limited by MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN
  - Batch checks against database
  - Downloads limited by MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN at download time only
  
- **Senate Scraper**: ✅ FIXED - Now working with correct selectors
  - Uses Puppeteer for JavaScript-heavy Castus platform
  - Handles m3u8 streams via ffmpeg
  - Fixed selectors: `.col-3.mb-3` containers with thumbnail extraction
  - Extracts video IDs from thumbnail URLs
  - Expected: 2000+ videos across 236 pages (10 per page)

### Video/Chunk Cleanup
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Working properly now
- Videos deleted after successful transcription
- Chunks deleted during processing
- Startup cleanup for orphaned files

## Smart Video Detection Strategy ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Overview
Scrapers discover ALL videos but database/processor limits downloads:

```
Scraper finds ALL → Check DB exists → Insert new only → Limit downloads
(3000+ videos)      (by url_hash)     (batch insert)    (MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN)
```

### Implementation Details
1. **Scrapers continue past MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN** ✅
   - Removed early exit in scraping loops
   - Both scrapers discover ALL videos
   - Only the download phase respects the limit

2. **Efficient Database Checking** ✅
   - Batch check for existing videos using `existsBatch()`
   - Single query checks 1000+ videos at once
   - Returns Set of existing URL hashes for O(1) lookup

3. **Batch Insert New Videos** ✅
   - `createBatch()` inserts multiple hearings in one query
   - Uses ON CONFLICT (url_hash) DO NOTHING
   - Logs how many were actually inserted

4. **Let index.ts Control Downloads** ✅
   - Scrapers just populate database
   - getPendingHearings() respects MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN
   - Downloads limited at runtime, not during scraping

## Graceful Failure Handling ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Strategy
- **Independent scrapers** - If one fails, the other continues
- **Track scraper health** - Store last success/failure in system_state
- **Continue on partial success** - Process what we can get
- **Clear error reporting** - Log which scraper failed and why

### Implementation
- Each scraper runs in its own try-catch block
- Scraper status tracked in system_state table with JSON details
- If both fail, log error and skip processing
- If one succeeds, process available videos
- Health status includes: status, timestamp, video count, error details

## Senate Scraper Solution ✅ FIXED

### Problem & Solution
- **Issue**: Castus platform uses React with dynamic content
- **Solution**: Found correct selectors by analyzing HTML structure
- **Working Selector**: `.col-3.mb-3` containers
- **Video ID Extraction**: From thumbnail URLs `/outputs/{id}/Default/Thumbnails/`
- **Title Extraction**: Text node after `.thumbnail` div

### Key Implementation Details
```javascript
// Extract video ID from thumbnail
const idMatch = thumbnailSrc.match(/\/outputs\/([a-z0-9]+)\//i);

// Title is text after thumbnail div
const titleElement = thumbnailDiv.nextSibling;
if (titleElement.nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE) {
    title = titleElement.textContent.trim();
}
```

## Database Optimization ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Indexes Added
- `idx_hearings_url_hash` - Fast lookups when checking existing videos
- `idx_hearings_download_status` - Efficient pending video queries
- `idx_hearings_download_transcription_status` - Composite index for common queries
- `idx_hearings_created_at` - Ordering by creation date

### Batch Operations Implemented
- `existsBatch()` - Check 1000+ videos in single query
- `createBatch()` - Insert multiple hearings with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
- Connection pool configured with 10 max connections

## Testing the Complete System

### 1. Quick Test (3 videos)
```bash
# Clean start
docker-compose down -v
rm -rf tmp/videos/* tmp/chunks/* transcriptions/*
docker-compose up -d postgres
sleep 5

# Test with 3 videos
MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=3 ./scripts/run-local.sh
```

### 2. Full Senate Scraper Test
```bash
# Test just Senate scraper
npm run build
node -e "
const { SenateScraper } = require('./dist/scrapers/michigan/senateScraper');
const scraper = new SenateScraper();
scraper.scrape().then(hearings => {
  console.log('Found hearings:', hearings.length);
  console.log('First 3:', hearings.slice(0, 3));
}).catch(console.error);
"
```

### 3. Monitor Background Process
```bash
# Start in background to avoid timeouts
nohup MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=5 ./scripts/run-local.sh > logs/test-run.log 2>&1 &
echo "Started with PID: $!"

# Watch progress
tail -f logs/test-run.log
```

## Testing Notes

- Michigan House videos are HUGE (1-4GB each, 1-2 hours long)
- Michigan Senate videos may be m3u8 streams
- Downloads take several minutes per video
- Transcription with chunking is much faster than sequential
- NO TIMEOUTS should be used when running tests

## Testing Without Timeouts (REQUIRED METHOD)

When the user asks to "test it", ALWAYS use this approach to avoid command timeouts:

### Background Process Method
```bash
# Start the test in background
nohup MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=3 ./scripts/run-local.sh > logs/test-run.log 2>&1 &
echo "Started process with PID: $!"

# Monitor progress without interrupting
tail -f logs/test-run.log  # User can press Ctrl+C to stop viewing (won't stop process)

# Or check progress periodically
tail -50 logs/test-run.log | grep -E "(Downloading|complete|Queue Status)"
```

### Direct Python Script (User Preference)
The user prefers to run the Python script directly:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://michigan_user:changeme@localhost:5432/michigan_hearings \
python3 scripts/parallel_processor.py --downloads 3 --transcriptions 2 --chunk-duration 30
```

### Check Running Processes
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "(run-local|parallel_processor)" | grep -v grep
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never use timeout parameters on Bash commands when running tests!

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed Senate Scraper** ✅
   - Debugged HTML structure to find correct selectors
   - Now extracts videos from `.col-3.mb-3` containers
   - Extracts IDs from thumbnail URLs, titles from text nodes
   - Added pagination handling to get all 236 pages (~2360 videos)
   - Progress logging every 10 pages

2. **Updated House Scraper** ✅
   - Added year iteration (2015-2025)
   - **Issue Found**: Year parameter not working on House site
   - Currently returns same 447 videos regardless of year
   - May need different approach or investigation

3. **Smart Video Detection** ✅
   - Both scrapers find ALL videos they can access
   - Batch check against database using URL hashes
   - Only new videos inserted
   - Downloads limited by MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN

4. **Database Optimization** ✅
   - Added batch operations (existsBatch, createBatch)
   - Indexes already exist in schema
   - Connection pooling configured

5. **Graceful Failure Handling** ✅
   - Each scraper runs independently
   - Health status tracked in system_state
   - System continues if one scraper fails

## CRITICAL: Correct Scraper Navigation Instructions

### Senate Scraper Navigation
1. **Start URL**: `https://cloud.castus.tv/vod/misenate/?page=ALL`
2. **Navigation**: Click button with class `btn btn-outline-primary` (bottom right arrow)
3. **Important**: URL does NOT change when navigating pages
4. **Wait Time**: 3-4 seconds for new videos to load after clicking
5. **Video Container**: Videos are in `div.row.mb-3.border-bottom`
6. **Page Size**: Select in `div.avResPerPage` - use 10 or 20 (NOT 50 - it doesn't load)

### House Scraper Navigation  
1. **Year Selection**: Use `select#FilterYear` dropdown
2. **Wait After Selection**: 1-2 seconds for selection to register
3. **Apply Filter**: Click button `#FilterCommand` (may need up to 3 attempts)
4. **Wait Time**: 5-7 seconds for results to load
5. **Verification**: Check first video title contains correct year
6. **Important**: URL parameters alone don't work - must use filter button

### Previously Attempted (WRONG) Approaches
1. **Senate**: Using URL parameters like `?perpage=10&page=2` - DOESN'T WORK
2. **House**: Using URL parameter `?year=2015` - DOESN'T WORK without filter button

## Video Count Summary (Verified)

### Total Videos Found: ~6,212

**Senate: ~2,360 videos**
- 236 total pages (10 videos per page)
- Page 1 sometimes empty on initial load (retry logic added)
- Consistent 10 videos per page after page 1

**House: 3,862 videos**
- Successfully scraped all years 2015-2025
- Video count by year:
  - 2015: 105 videos
  - 2016: 92 videos
  - 2017: 110 videos
  - 2018: 87 videos
  - 2019: 560 videos (significant increase)
  - 2020: 460 videos
  - 2021: 626 videos (peak year)
  - 2022: 395 videos
  - 2023: 576 videos
  - 2024: 404 videos
  - 2025: 447 videos (so far)

### Performance Timing
- **Senate full scan**: ~20-30 minutes (4 seconds per page × 236 pages)
- **House full scan**: ~1.4 minutes (all 11 years)
- **Total time**: ~25-35 minutes for complete system scan
- Batch operations ready to handle 6,000+ videos efficiently

## Current Implementation Status (Final)

### Scrapers ✅ FULLY WORKING
1. **Senate Scraper**
   - Uses button navigation at `?page=ALL`
   - Properly waits for content to load
   - Retry logic for page 1 (up to 3 attempts)
   - Initial 6-second wait for first page
   - Extracts all ~2,360 videos

2. **House Scraper**
   - Uses Puppeteer with filter button interaction
   - Waits 1.5 seconds after year selection
   - Clicks filter button (up to 3 attempts with verification)
   - Successfully gets all historical data (2015-2025)
   - Total 3,862 videos found

### Architecture ✅ COMPLETE
- Smart video detection: Find all, insert new only
- Batch database operations for efficiency
- Graceful failure handling
- Independent scraper execution
- Downloads limited by MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN

### Known Minor Issues
1. **Senate Page 1**: Sometimes loads empty initially
   - Solution: Retry logic with 5-second waits implemented
   
2. **Long Running Senate Scrape**: Takes 20-30 minutes
   - Consider: Adding checkpoint/resume capability for production

### Ready for Production ✅
The system now successfully:
- Detects all 6,000+ Michigan Legislature videos
- Handles JavaScript-heavy sites correctly
- Processes videos in parallel with Python
- Meets all State Affairs Technical Exercise requirements

## Next Steps After Compact

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Test Senate scraper (3 pages)
SENATE_MAX_PAGES=3 npm run start

# Test House scraper (2 years)
HOUSE_START_YEAR=2024 HOUSE_END_YEAR=2025 npm run start

# Full system test with 5 videos
MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=5 ./scripts/run-local.sh
```

### Production Deployment
1. Set up cron job for periodic runs
2. Configure MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN based on server capacity
3. Monitor first full scan (~25-35 minutes)
4. Check logs for any page 1 retry attempts

### Optional Enhancements
1. Add progress checkpointing for Senate scraper
2. Implement webhook notifications for new videos
3. Add metrics dashboard for video processing stats
4. Consider distributed processing for faster transcription

## Latest Implementation Updates (July 29, 2025)

### Scraper Improvements Implemented ✅
1. **Dynamic Page Count Detection**
   - Senate scraper now reads total pages from `.avPageCount` div
   - No more hardcoded page counts
   - Continues scraping until no more videos found if count not detected

2. **Smart Scraping Limits** 
   - Both scrapers stop when enough NEW videos are found
   - Checks against database to skip existing videos
   - Environment variables:
     - `SENATE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=5` - Stop after finding 5 new Senate videos
     - `HOUSE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=5` - Stop after finding 5 new House videos
     - Set to `-1` for unlimited (full scan)

3. **House Scraper Reversed Order**
   - Now starts from current year (2025) and works backwards
   - Matches Senate behavior of newest-first
   - More efficient for finding recent videos

4. **Video URL Storage During Scraping**
   - Set `FETCH_VIDEO_URLS_DURING_SCRAPE=true` to fetch URLs immediately
   - Stores URLs in database during initial scrape
   - Avoids re-fetching during download phase

### Senate Video Download Solution 🎥

**Problem**: Current implementation finds m3u8 URLs but they're blob URLs that don't download properly.

**Solution 1 - Try Blob URL Download First**: 
The m3u8 URLs we're finding (e.g., `https://dlttx48mxf9m3.cloudfront.net/outputs/{id}/Default/HLS/1080p.m3u8`) should work with ffmpeg:

```bash
ffmpeg -i "https://dlttx48mxf9m3.cloudfront.net/outputs/{id}/Default/HLS/1080p.m3u8" -c copy output.mp4
```

The issue was the tmp directory didn't exist. After creating it, these URLs should download properly.

**Solution 2 - Share Button Fallback**: 
If blob URLs fail, use the share/download button on the video player page:

```javascript
// Navigate to video page and wait for player
await page.goto(hearing.sourceUrl);
await page.waitForSelector('video', { timeout: 10000 });

// Click share button
const shareButton = await page.$('i.fas.fa-share.text-secondary.mr-2');
await shareButton.click();
await page.waitForSelector('.share-item', { timeout: 5000 });

// Click download option
const downloadButton = await page.$('div.share-item[data-for="downloadVideo"]');
await downloadButton.click();

// Wait for download to start (30-60 seconds typical)
let downloadStarted = false;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 30000)); // 30 seconds
    
    // Check if download started (implementation depends on how site handles it)
    // May need to intercept download or check for new network requests
    const downloads = await page.evaluate(() => {
        // Check for active downloads or new windows
        return window.performance.getEntriesByType('resource')
            .filter(e => e.name.includes('.mp4'));
    });
    
    if (downloads.length > 0) {
        downloadStarted = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

### Environment Variables Summary

```bash
# Core Configuration
MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=3        # Total videos to download per run (across both chambers)
MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=3     # Concurrent video downloads
MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSCRIPTIONS=2 # Concurrent transcriptions

# House Scraper Configuration
HOUSE_START_YEAR=2015         # Oldest year to scrape
HOUSE_END_YEAR=2025           # Newest year to scrape
HOUSE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=-1       # -1 for unlimited, or specific number

# Senate Scraper Configuration
SENATE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=-1      # -1 for unlimited, or specific number
SENATE_MAX_PAGES=-1           # Limit pages to scrape (-1 for all)
SENATE_PAGE_SIZE=20           # Videos per page (10 or 20 recommended)

# Behavior flags  
FETCH_VIDEO_URLS_DURING_SCRAPE=true  # Fetch video URLs while scraping
RUN_ONCE=true                         # Run once and exit
SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true                    # Skip download phase
DELETE_AFTER_TRANSCRIPTION=true       # Delete videos after transcribing
```

### Using run-local.sh

The `run-local.sh` script is now the single entry point for the system. Configure your `.env` file with the desired settings, then run:

```bash
# Example: Download 20 Senate videos and 10 House videos
# In .env:
SENATE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=20
HOUSE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=10
MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=30

# Run normally:
./scripts/run-local.sh

# Run with clean start (clears database and transcriptions):
./scripts/run-local.sh --clean
```

The script will:
1. Display all configuration settings
2. Optionally clean database and files (with --clean flag)
3. Run scrapers with the specified limits
4. Download and transcribe videos
5. Show progress and final summary

**Note**: The --clean flag will:
- Truncate all database tables
- Remove all transcription files (*.txt and *.json)
- Remove all video and chunk files

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test Senate scraper with limits
SENATE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=2 FETCH_VIDEO_URLS_DURING_SCRAPE=true npm run start

# Test House scraper newest first
HOUSE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=5 npm run start

# Full system test
RUN_ONCE=true MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=3 ./scripts/run-local.sh
```

## Current Session Summary (July 30, 2025 - Production Ready)

### Latest Updates & Fixes

1. **Fixed Corrupted MP4 Download Issue** ✅
   - Issue: "Thursday, February 20, 2025" video had "moov atom not found" error
   - Root cause: Incomplete download (network interruption)
   - Solution: Added ffprobe video integrity check before transcription
   - Result: Corrupted videos are detected and cleaned up automatically

2. **Fixed Video Deletion Issues** ✅
   - Issue: Videos not being deleted after transcription
   - Root cause: Videos only deleted when status = "completed"
   - Solution: Fixed database status updates and added cleanup for stuck downloads
   - Result: Proper cleanup after successful transcription

3. **Simplified Database Schema** ✅
   - Removed 13 unused columns that were never populated
   - Schema now only contains essential fields for tracking
   - No migrations needed - clean schema from the start

4. **Clarified Queue Architecture** ✅
   - Removed unnecessary SQS references from documentation
   - Clarified that PostgreSQL serves as the job queue
   - Added "How Queueing Works" section to README
   - System is simpler and more maintainable without external queues

5. **Fixed Semaphore Resource Warnings** ✅
   - Issue: Python multiprocessing leaving semaphore objects uncleaned
   - Solution: Added proper pool cleanup with close(), join(), and terminate()
   - Result: Clean shutdown without resource warnings

6. **Identified Stuck Download Issue** ✅
   - Issue: Videos stuck in "downloading" status won't be retried
   - Example: "Thursday, March 6, 2025" stuck with corrupted download
   - Solution: run-local.sh already handles this with cleanup logic
   - Important: Use --clean flag to reset stuck downloads

7. **Enhanced Retry Logic for Failed Downloads** ✅
   - Updated both TypeScript and Python to retry failed downloads
   - Will retry if: download failed AND no successful transcription exists
   - Also retries videos stuck in "downloading" for over 30 minutes
   - This ensures the system is self-healing and resilient

8. **Simplified Database Schema** ✅
   - Removed 13 unused columns that were never populated
   - Removed: description, committee, date_published, video_duration_seconds, 
     transcription_model, transcription_cost_estimate, audio_file_path, 
     audio_format, audio_size_bytes, transcription_content_start_time,
     transcription_content_lines, transcription_silence_trimmed_seconds,
     transcription_stored_in_db
   - Kept only essential fields for tracking downloads and transcriptions
   - No migrations folder - clean schema from the start

9. **Dynamic tmp Folder Management** ✅
   - tmp/ folder no longer in version control
   - Created dynamically when processing starts
   - Automatically removed when processing completes
   - Prevents leftover files in production

### How the System Actually Works

**Queue Implementation**:
```
TypeScript Scrapers → PostgreSQL (Queue) → Python Processor
                           ↓
                    Status Tracking:
                    - pending
                    - downloading/processing  
                    - completed
                    - failed (retry next run)
```

**Key Insights**:
- PostgreSQL is the persistent job queue
- No external queue system needed (no SQS, Redis, etc.)
- Failed items automatically retried on next run
- asyncio queues are just for internal worker coordination

### Test Results Summary

**Test 1 (2 House + 5 Senate)**: ✅ Success with minor issues
- 4/5 videos transcribed successfully
- 1 House video corrupted during download
- Fixed with integrity checking

**Test 2 (2 House + 2 Senate)**: ✅ Success
- 3/4 videos transcribed
- 1 House video failed (corrupted download)
- System handled failure gracefully

**Test 3 (2 House + 2 Senate with MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=4)**: ⚠️ Partial Success
- 3/4 videos transcribed successfully (75% success rate)
- 1 video failed during download when concurrency was too high
- No leftover videos - cleanup working perfectly!
- Performance: 16.8x realtime transcription speed
- Recommendation: Keep MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=3 for stability

### Ready for Production Use

The system is now production-ready with:
- ✅ Robust error handling and recovery
- ✅ Video integrity verification
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of failed downloads
- ✅ Database-driven queue (simple, reliable)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Support for both MP4 and m3u8 formats

### Next Steps

1. **Run Final Clean Test**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-local.sh --clean
   ```
   Monitor for successful completion of all 4 videos

2. **Run Deduplication Test**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-local.sh
   ```
   Verify it finds 4 new videos (not re-processing existing)

3. **Set Up Cron Schedule**:
   ```bash
   # Run every 6 hours
   0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/project && ./scripts/run-local.sh >> logs/cron.log 2>&1
   ```

4. **Monitor Production**:
   - Check logs regularly
   - Monitor disk space
   - Review failed videos weekly

   - Add download progress bars
   - Implement connection pooling for downloads
   - Add parallel scraping

2. **Reliability**:
   - Add email notifications for failures
   - Implement health checks endpoint
   - Add Grafana dashboard

3. **Scale** (if needed):
   - Deploy to AWS with EC2/Lambda
   - Use S3 for video storage
   - RDS for managed PostgreSQL

### Configuration for Production

```bash
# .env for production
MAX_HEARINGS_PER_RUN=20        # Process more videos
MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=3      # Keep at 3 for stability (4+ causes failures)
MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSCRIPTIONS=4 # Use more CPU cores
HOUSE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=-1        # Unlimited
SENATE_MAX_NEW_VIDEOS=-1       # Unlimited
DELETE_AFTER_TRANSCRIPTION=true # Save disk space
```

### Critical Configuration Notes

**MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS**: Testing shows that setting this above 3 causes download failures. The system works reliably with 3 concurrent downloads, achieving ~78 MB/s average download speed.

### Key Learnings

1. **Simple is Better**: Database as queue works perfectly
2. **Hybrid Architecture**: TypeScript for web scraping + Python for ML
3. **Error Recovery**: Let database track state, retry on next run
4. **Video Formats**: House uses MP4, Senate uses m3u8/HLS
5. **Large Files**: House videos can be 1-4GB, need patience

The system is ready for submission to State Affairs! 🎉

## Documentation Consolidation Plan (Pending Implementation)

### Current Documentation Structure Issues
1. **Scattered Documentation**:
   - README.md - Basic overview
   - SETUP.md - Detailed setup (439 lines, possibly outdated)
   - docs/AWS_ARCHITECTURE.md - AWS deployment plan (389 lines, theoretical)
   - Multiple overlapping files

2. **Outdated Information**:
   - SETUP.md still references creating tmp directories manually
   - AWS_ARCHITECTURE.md mentions SQS which we don't use
   - Some instructions may not reflect current implementation

3. **Unnecessary Files/Folders**:
   - logs/ folder with 17 old log files
   - docs/ folder with just one file
   - migrations/ folder in root directory (only has 003_add_url_hash_index.sql)
   - Possible docker.md and typescript files

### Consolidation Plan

#### 1. Create Comprehensive README.md
Merge all documentation into one well-organized README with these sections:

#### 2. Update aws/batch-config.yaml
Current issues:
- Uses ECS/Fargate (we need Lambda + EC2 Spot hybrid)
- No SQS integration (we use PostgreSQL)
- Missing video size routing logic

Updates needed:
- Lambda function for videos < 100MB
- EC2 Spot Fleet for videos > 100MB
- Step Functions for orchestration
- Remove EFS (use S3 + local storage)
- Add video size detection and routing

#### 3. Files to Delete
- **Entire logs/ folder** - Already in .gitignore, old test logs
- **docs/ folder** - After moving content to README
- **SETUP.md** - After consolidation
- **migrations/ folder in root** - Only has one old migration
- **docker.md** - If exists
- **typescript file** - If exists

#### 4. Important Information to Preserve in CLAUDE.md
From logs review:
- Successful m3u8 fix for Senate videos
- Optimal concurrent settings (3 downloads, 2 transcriptions)
- Video size patterns (House: 1-4GB, Senate: 20-500MB)
- Performance metrics (16.8x realtime transcription)
- Common errors and solutions

### Implementation Order
1. First: Update this CLAUDE.md with all findings
2. Create new comprehensive README.md
3. Update aws/batch-config.yaml
4. Delete unnecessary files/folders
5. Final review and cleanup

### Key Learnings to Include
- Database as queue works perfectly (no external queue needed)
- MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS should stay at 3
- tmp/ folder should be dynamic (created/deleted per run)
- Schema simplified to essential fields only
- Retry logic for failed downloads is crucial

## Python Script Column Reference Issues (CRITICAL - Fix After Compact)

### Problem Discovered
After updating the database schema to remove unused columns and fixing TypeScript code, the Python `parallel_processor.py` script still uses old column names, causing failures:

**Error**: `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column "video_url" does not exist`

### Column Mapping Changes Needed

| Old Column Name | New Column Name | Location in parallel_processor.py |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `video_url` | `url` | Lines 144, 163, 170, 210, 506 |
| `state` | (removed - redundant) | Lines 506, 519 |
| `error_message` | (removed) | Line 275 |
| `video_filename` | `video_file_path` | Lines 297, 519, 655-656 |
| `downloaded_at` | `download_completed_at` | Line 299 |

### Specific Fixes Required

1. **Line 506**: Change query from:
   ```python
   SELECT id, title, video_url, state, chamber
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   SELECT id, title, url, chamber
   ```

2. **Line 144**: Change:
   ```python
   video_url = hearing['video_url']
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   video_url = hearing['url']
   ```

3. **Line 275**: Remove error_message update:
   ```python
   f"UPDATE hearings SET {status_field} = %s, error_message = %s WHERE id = %s"
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   f"UPDATE hearings SET {status_field} = %s WHERE id = %s"
   ```

4. **Lines 297, 299**: Update column names:
   ```python
   video_filename = %s,
   downloaded_at = NOW()
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   video_file_path = %s,
   download_completed_at = NOW()
   ```

5. **Line 519**: Update SELECT query:
   ```python
   SELECT id, title, video_filename, state, chamber
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   SELECT id, title, video_file_path, chamber
   ```

6. **Lines 655-656**: Update variable names:
   ```python
   video_filename = hearing.get('video_filename', f"{hearing_id}.mp4")
   video_path = self.videos_dir / video_filename
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   video_file_path = hearing.get('video_file_path', None)
   if video_file_path:
       video_path = Path(video_file_path)
   else:
       video_path = self.videos_dir / f"{hearing_id}.mp4"
   ```

### Database Schema Changes Summary

The simplified schema removed these columns:
- `state` (always 'MI')
- `error_message`
- `video_filename` → replaced with `video_file_path`
- `downloaded_at` → replaced with `download_completed_at` and `download_started_at`
- `description`, `committee`, `date_published`, `video_duration_seconds`
- `transcription_model`, `transcription_cost_estimate`
- `audio_file_path`, `audio_format`, `audio_size_bytes`
- `transcription_content_start_time`, `transcription_content_lines`
- `transcription_silence_trimmed_seconds`, `transcription_stored_in_db`

5. **Git Repository Initialized** ✅
   - Created .gitignore with proper exclusions
   - Ready for initial commit

## Scalability Considerations for Production

### Multi-State Support
To support other states beyond Michigan:

1. **Database Schema Changes**
   ```sql
   -- Add state column back (was removed as redundant for MI-only)
   ALTER TABLE hearings ADD COLUMN state VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'MI';
   CREATE INDEX idx_hearings_state ON hearings(state);
   ```

2. **Scraper Architecture**
   ```typescript
   // Create base scraper interface
   interface StateScraper {
     state: string;
     scrapeHouse(): Promise<Hearing[]>;
     scraperSenate(): Promise<Hearing[]>;
   }
   
   // Implement for each state
   class CaliforniaScraper implements StateScraper { }
   class TexasScraper implements StateScraper { }
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   ```env
   STATES=MI,CA,TX,NY
   SCRAPER_CONCURRENCY=4
   ```

### AWS Architecture for Scale

#### Phase 1: Basic AWS Deployment
1. **EC2 for Scrapers** (t3.medium)
   - Run TypeScript scrapers on schedule
   - Store videos in S3 instead of local disk
   - Use RDS PostgreSQL instead of local DB

2. **Lambda for Small Videos** (<100MB)
   - Transcribe directly in Lambda (15 min timeout)
   - Cost-effective for small videos

3. **EC2 Spot for Large Videos** (>100MB)
   - Use Spot Fleet with c5.2xlarge instances
   - Process in parallel with SQS queue
   - Auto-terminate when queue empty

#### Phase 2: Full Serverless Architecture
```yaml
Architecture:
  Scrapers:
    - Lambda functions triggered by EventBridge (cron)
    - Store metadata in DynamoDB
    - Videos go directly to S3
  
  Processing:
    - Step Functions orchestrate workflow
    - Lambda for videos <100MB
    - ECS Fargate for videos >100MB
    - SQS for job queuing
  
  Storage:
    - S3 for videos (lifecycle policies for deletion)
    - RDS Aurora Serverless for metadata
    - ElasticSearch for transcription search
```

#### Cost Optimization
1. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**
   - Automatically moves old videos to cheaper storage
   - Delete after 30-90 days

2. **Spot Instances**
   - 70-90% cost savings for transcription
   - Use Spot Fleet with multiple instance types

3. **Reserved Capacity**
   - RDS reserved instances for database
   - Compute Savings Plans for Lambda

### Performance at Scale

#### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Partitioning by state and date
CREATE TABLE hearings_2025_mi PARTITION OF hearings
FOR VALUES FROM ('MI', '2025-01-01') TO ('MI', '2026-01-01');

-- Read replicas for scraper queries
-- Write to primary, read from replicas
```

#### Caching Strategy
1. **Redis for URL deduplication**
   - Cache all URL hashes in Redis
   - Much faster than DB queries

2. **CloudFront for video delivery**
   - If serving videos publicly
   - Reduces S3 costs

#### Monitoring & Alerting
1. **CloudWatch Metrics**
   - Scraper success rates
   - Processing times
   - Cost per video

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Sentry for application errors
   - CloudWatch Logs Insights for analysis

3. **Dashboards**
   - Grafana for real-time metrics
   - QuickSight for business analytics

### Example Terraform for AWS Deployment

          Cluster = aws_ecs_cluster.main.arn
        }
        End = true
      }
    }
  })
}
```
